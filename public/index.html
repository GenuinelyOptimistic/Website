									<h1>The Mission</h1>
									<p class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">Hi, and thank you for visiting this site. My name is Denzil Doyle CEO and founder of Genuinely Optimistic, Go for short. For the past few years I have been trying to build a successful business and when I use the word “successful” here I don’t mean one that makes a lot of money. I am talking about a business that is valuable, impactful and something I am happy to be a part of.</p>
									<p class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">Unfortunately, the journey to start such a company has been not surprisingly a challenging one and I have failed countless times for several different reasons. However, I am not giving up. I have learned a lot along the way, especially about some of the tools startups can benefit from. Unfortunately, some of these tools are not available locally. It is with this knowledge that the idea for my most recent endeavor was born Genuinely Optimistic.</p>
									<p class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">Go will provide tools and services for starters (entrepreneurs and small businesses) to accelerate growth and be more profitable. However no matter how robust the tools, nothing drives growth like a community working together with one common goal in mind. This is where you come in, I would like to invite you to help me build the foundation of Genuinely Optimistic (Go). To grow and improve the local entrepreneurship community together. There is an African proverb that goes;</p>
									<blockquote><p>“If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”</p></blockquote>
									<p class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">Join the movement, let’s go together.</p>
									<p>Regards,<br>
									Denzil Doyle</p>

									Together we go!</p>
